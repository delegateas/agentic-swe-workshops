# Agentic Software Engineering Workshops

Hands-on workshops for building with AI agents. Learn by doing, not just reading.

## The Big Idea

AI agents are simpler than you think — the core loop is ~200 lines of code. These workshops demystify agents through interactive exercises using Polyglot Notebooks, so you can experiment and see results immediately.

## Workshops

| Workshop | Description | Duration |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [Agents, MCP & Skills](agents-mcp-skills.dib) | Build an agent from scratch, implement MCP servers, create reusable skills | 3.5 hours |

*More workshops coming soon.*
